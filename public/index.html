        CVBuilder is simple a service to edit and share professional r&eacute;sum&eacute;s built on top of linked data and semantic web technologies.

          <dd>CVBuilder uses RDF as the main data model to expose and manipulate
            the data stored in the application. This information is described using
            standard vocabularies like FOAF or VCard. Furthermore, every bit of
            information has an associated URI so it can be easily linked from other
            documents and applications.</dd>
        </dl>

        <dl>
          <dt>Privacy and authentication</dt>
          <dd>Authentication in CVBuilder is based on the FOAF+SSL mechanism
            being developed W3C's WebID Incubator Group. This authentication
            mechanism allows users to control their identity and privacy using
            standard technologies like URIs, SSL certificates and the FOAF
            vocabulary.</dd>
        </dl>
        <dl>
          <dt>RESTful API</dt>
          <dd>CVBuilder offers a RESTful API where every resource identified by
            an URI and containing a RDF graph can be manipulated using the standard
            HTTP interface. Every RDF graph can be retrieved in the JSON-LD
            serialization format this makes easy to work with RDF graphs as if they
            were standard JSON objects.</dd>
        </dl>
        <dl>
          <dt>Open Source</dt>
          <dd>One goal of the project was to build a web application with
            semantic web technologies but using mainstream development
            tools. CVBuilder uses a standard relational storage solution (MySQL),
            uses Ruby on Rails to generate the database schema and a lightweight
            web framework to route requests to the application logic (Compojure). A
            small logic layer has been developed capable of translating SPARQL
            queries into SQL queries. All the code of the application is open
            source and can be retrieved from our account in Github.</dd>
