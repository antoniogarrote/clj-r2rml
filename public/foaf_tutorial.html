        Setting up FOAF+SSL authentication with current browsers is not yet a
        streamlined process. The situation will surely improve in the future if the
        technology gains adoption. </br>
      From the end user point of view, it introduces some concepts quite different
      from other authentication mechanisms like OAuth.
      To be able to use FOAF+SSL to gain access to a web resource there is a
      number of requirements that must be in place:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>The user must have a WebID: anxs URI identifying the user when accessing
          a resource (e.g. http://foaf.me/some_person#me)</li>
        <li>The WebID must be contained in a RDF public document that can be
          retrieved via URI (e.g. http://foaf.me/some_person.rdf).</li>
        <li>A X509 certificate must be associated to that WebID and public
          information about the certificate must be inserted in the RDF public
          document containing the WebID. The FOAF vocabulary must be used to
          describe this information about the certificate and the WebID</li>
        <li>When the user, or the web browser in the name of the user, tries to
          retrieve a resource on the web protected using the HTTPS protocol, it must be able to
          send the X509 certificate associated to the WebID in the HTTPS request if
          required by the web server.</li>
      </ul>

        <p>
          Since the X509 certificate is associated to the WebID of the user, and this
          WebID is just a plain URI, the web server can retrieve the RDF document
          containing the WebID and the public information about the associated
          certificate. With this information it can check that the certificate sent is
          really associated to the claimed WebID and decide if the user has access to
          the rquested resource.<br/>

          It is interesting to note that the real power of FOAF+SSL becomes apparent
          if you consider that the web server can decide if allow access to the
          resource to a user considering not only the access right of this user, but
          any relation of trust between the user accessing the resource and any other
          user. Additionally these relationships of trust can be exposed as RDF graphs
          using the FOAF vocabulary and linked to public URIs that can be retrieved
          using the HTTP protocol.
        </p>

        <p>
          This section describes the steps required to get a WebID, create a FOAF
          document in the web with an associated certificate and install the
          certificate in a web browser.
        </p>

        <p>
          The process can be completed with any browser, but the details will vary
          from one user to other. In this example we will use Firefox 4 RC1.
        </p>

        <p>
          To build a WebID and store it into a public webserver with an associated
          URI we could use our own web server, but is usually more convenient to
          use an online provider. One possible provider
          is <a href='http://foaf.me/'>foaf.me</a>.
        </p>

        <img src='pics/steps/step2.png'></img>

        <p>
          From the main page of <a href='http://foaf.me'>foaf.me</a> we can
          introduce some personal details that will be stored using the FOAF
          vocabulary in the document containing our WebID.
        </p>

        <img src='pics/steps/step3.png'></img>

        <p>
          While entering the personal details, we can see in the box below the RDF
          document with our personal information and the WebID in the XML
          serialization of RDF.<br/>
          The final text for our WebID URI can also be edited in the text field
          located next to the save button.
        </p>

        <img src='pics/steps/step4.png'></img>

        <p>
          Once we have submitted the form and if everything is correct, we will
          have created a new WebID and store it in a RDF document located at the
          <a href='http://foaf.me/'>foaf.me</a> web server.</br>
        After that, <a href='http://foaf.me/'>foaf.me</a> allows us to create a X509 certificate and
        associate it to the RDF document.
      </p>

    <p>
      The process should be handled automatically by the browser,
      nevertheless, a number of screens with warnings will be displayed by
      Firefox while installing the certificate. We can safely ignore all
      them. Some of these warnings are displayed because FOAF+SSL makes use of
      SSL certificates in a different way than the common one. In FOAF+SSL
      certificates do not need to be trusted by any certification
      authority. They are essentially self-signed certificates and this kind of
      certificates are generally not trusted by HTTP agents like web
      browsers. The security component in FOAF+SSL is instead achieved by
      including the URI with our WebID inside the signed certificate and
      matching the certificate information against the public information
      stored in the RDF document associated to the WebID.
    </p>

    <p>
      If there are no errors, the certificate should be now installed in the
      web browser. If we close and restart the browser, we are ready to use it with any FOAF+SSL secured
      resource. The certificate can be exported from Firefox and installed in
      any other web browser or HTTP client we use.
    </p>

    <p>
      If we try to open a connection  to
      the <a http='https://antoniogarrote.com/cvbuilder/client.html'>CVBuilder</a>
      web application using a secure HTTPS connection, Firefox will display
      a dialog box requesting us to select the certificate we want to use to
      identify ourselves in the HTTPS request. We can select the certificate
      we have just created.</p>
  <p>
    (Unfortunately, Firefox does not trust the certification authority of our web server,
    so an additional warning about the server will be displayed. The problem
    is not present if you are using other browsers like Chrome or Safari).
  </p>

  <img src='pics/steps/step13.png'></img>

  <p>
    When the certificate is transmitted in the HTTPS request, CVBuilder will
    retrieve the RDF document stored in
    the <a href='http://foaf.me/'>foaf.me</a> containing the information associated to
    your WebID. It will check that the public information about the
    certificate matches the one sent in the HTTPS request and grant you
    access to the protected resource being requested.
